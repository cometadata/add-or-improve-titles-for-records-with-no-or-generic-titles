# Add or Improve Titles for Records with No or Generic Titles

This is a COMET enrichment and curation workflow pilot project. Go to the [Pilot Projects Overview Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/14) to see all of the pilots.  

## Objective

Identify works within the Crossref and DataCite that lack titles, or have generic titles (e.g. “Dataset”), and analyze any consistent patterns associated with these gaps, and evaluate the feasibility of scalable methods for title identification and repair. 

## Getting Involved
